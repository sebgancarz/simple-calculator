### JS Mega-K 5.2 - home work

1.  Create a class-based claculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide.
2.  The class in the constructor receives the number a and the number b. It also has methods: add, subtract, multiply and divide. They return the relevant data.
3.  Add validation to the constructor - checking if the given data are numbers. Show error if not.
4.  To the division method also add a check that the number b is not 0.
5.  Accept two numbers by the \`prompt\`. Create a new object based on the class and pass the user numbers to it. Perform all actions and view them on the console. Use \`try ... catch\` to catch any errors and display them to the user.
